                Japanese businessman, video game programmer, video game
                designer, and producer. He was the fourth president and chief
                executive officer (CEO) of Nintendo. He was a major contributor
                in broadening the appeal of video games by focusing on novel and
                entertaining games rather than top-of-the-line hardware.

                    judge products based on instinct. Everyone wants to appeal
                    to people's instincts, but it's not easy."</em
